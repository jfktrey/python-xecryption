python-xecryption
=================

A Python-based XECryption cracking tool created as a full-blown cracking tool for HackThisSite.org's Realistic mission #6. ***Do not use this for getting past the mission. You will learn nothing. This was intended to be a research project.***

This code was written when I was much less experienced and is undoubtedly messy.

Roadmap:
--------
*  Clean up code
*  Include encryption functionality
