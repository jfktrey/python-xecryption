python-xecryption
=================

A Python-based XECryption cracking tool created as a full-blown cracking tool for HackThisSite.org's Realistic mission #6.

This code was written when I was much less experienced. Please forgive me.

***Do not use this for getting past the mission. You will learn nothing. It was intended as a research project.***
